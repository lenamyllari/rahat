web-project (html, css, js, photo and video editing)
School project for a course where we studied HTML, SCC, JavaScript and photo/video editing.
I've got the idea of the webpage from my previous work experience - 
I was working in a bank mainly selling different currencies to customers. 
We had many discussion on what happens when people won't be using cash anymore. 
In this project I was in charge of the Javascript part, the quezz, the database we've used for voting and photo editing but I've participated in the other parts too.
Our website consists of several pages: 
- main page, 
- video contest with voting, 
- gallery with bancnotes and coins, 
- a map with the bancoffices, 
- currency exchange page where you can also see the weather in the capital of the country where this currency is used,
- about us,
- a quezz about currencies,
- a short story about the idea.
